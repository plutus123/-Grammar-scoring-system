Okay, sorry, I just, I'm not sure if the right thing to do is jump in or not. I haven't done this before. It's all completely new. Yeah, that's true. So, yeah, but my answer to your question is, is no, but I guess you want a bit more than that. Of course, we're going to dive into that. Okay, why, why do you say no? There's a few reasons. I mean, even in terms of what we consider fluency, has nothing to do with accent or anything. It's, it's not even actually the same thing as proficiency. So, what you, how you sound has nothing to do with your fluency really. And as long as you can communicate fluently and you, you know, you don't, you know, you're not having to kind of stop and you're not, there's nothing that kind of impedes your communication, then you can be considered fluent. So, yeah, sounding like a native speaker or your accent is kind of something separate from that anyway.",
